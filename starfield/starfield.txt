starfield.py - A starfield class for pygame.

starfield.py is a pretty solid class for rendering a parallax starfield
effect onto an arbitrary surface.  You can set the number of stars, their
angle, speed, color and size.  You can render onto the entire surface, or
just a certain portion of that surface.  You can change the starfield's
direction and speed on the fly.

The class includes an example script - just run "python starfield.py" to
see it. Use the arrow keys. Up/Down changes the speed of the starfield, and
Right/Left changes the direction in ten degree increments.  Hit ESC to quit.

There are two flaws I can see in the code. First, the 
Star._calculate_axis_speeds() function is slow (although it's as fast as
possible without forcing the user to specify angles in radians :))  The result
is a visible pause when changing starfield direction or speed.  The function
was written to allow arbitrary angles; most games don't need that kind of
precision.  Try precalculating the values that you'll need before the game
begins, then plugging them into this function during gameplay, rather than
recalculating these trig values every time the user hits a key.

The second flaw is that the stars are drawn in the order they're created, not
in z-order from furthest to closest.  Try setting the STAR_SIZE_IN_PIXELS to 
10 to see the effect - more distant stars occasionally move over closer ones.
This effect may be visible with any star size over 1, although at lower values,
the effect will be negligible.  Star sizes over 2 aren't recommended anyway, 
since the stars are square, not round :)
